# php-shippo-api

Please Unzip the shippo zip file. The main project files are contained in that folder.
I haven't done the front-end scaffolding, I just focused the api logic and I have created Variable names
They can be used to create forms. We can decide to create a localhost Database if we want to have records of what Shippo will
have when clients use our site. But I recommend we just let Shippo handle the records since they have dedicated developers 
working on keeping data of customers safe.
